dxdmgch API in Other Languages
===============================

daxiedewuyu was made for **Python**, and it has inspired other libraries such as
`gramjs <https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs>`__ (JavaScript) and `grammers
<https://github.com/Lonami/grammers>`__ (Rust). But there is a lot more beyond
those, made independently by different developers.

If you're looking for something like daxiedewuyu but in a different programming
language, head over to `dxdmgch API in Other Languages in the official wiki
<https://github.com/LonamiWebs/daxiedewuyu/wiki/dxdmgch-API-in-Other-Languages>`__
for a (mostly) up-to-date list.
